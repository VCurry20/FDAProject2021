## Purpose of this Repository

The overall purpose of this notebook is two fold, the first is to explore the purpose and use of Matplotlib-pyplot, the second is to upload, clean and use the data from the CAO points for three years.

In this repository you will find two differnt Jupyter notebooks, which have been used to document the process of each of these aims.



In the first Jupyter notebook I have reviewed Matplotlib and the use of Matplotlib plotting, concentrating on 3 main plots and their advantanges and disadvantages.

I had also included the brief for this project for review in a seperate folder.



In the second Jupyter notebook, I have downloaded and worked on the CAO points for 2021, 2020 and 2019.

These files are in three different forms - HTML, Excel and a PDF.

I have used Pandas to create a dataframe of these yearly points - these included level 6, 7, & 8 points.

Cleaning this data and ensuring that all of this data is ready to work on takes up a large portion of the CAO Jupyter notebook.

### Anaconda Install

To install and use Python you can download it directly [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

You can install this on your Windows, Mac or Linux OS

<br/>

### Additional Requirements

(Please note that these specifications are for Windows and may differ for the other OS)

It is also recommended that you should install the following along side Anaconda

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - This is a code editor and will allow you to create and view the code


[CMDR](https://cmder.net/) - which will allow you to access the terminal on your computer - you can use this as an alternative command line


[Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Which will allow you to connect with Guthub and Fork this respository


<br/>

### Accessing Git Hub

When you have installed Anaconda and the additional required programs you can then fork github - this allows you to take a copy of this repository and save it to your computer where you can interact with the code - running it, changing it, and testing different parts of it. 

None of these actions you make to this forked copy effects the repository

You will find this fork symbol on the top right of the repository. You can also star the repository allowing you to save the repository to come back to.

<br/>

### Libraries Used

For this project I have used the following librares within Python:

-  `NumPy`, which is numerical python

-  `Pandas`, which allows us to create dataframes and is a step up from the numerical capablities of `NumPy`

- `Matplotlib`, which I review and use for plotting

- `Seaborn`, which is built on `Matplotlib` and expands on its capabilities

- `Scipy`, which allows for use to analyise data

- `requests`, a HTTP library for Python

<br/>

If you do not either have the space on your device for this full Python download Install or are perhaps reviewing this Repository as a starting point for Python and Jupyter Notebookes, I have also included below the details to access the notebooks without downloading Anaconda.
