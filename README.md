## Purpose of this Repository

The overall purpose of this notebook is two fold, the first is to explore the purpose and use of Matplotlib-pyplot, the second is to upload, clean and use the data from the CAO points for three years.

In this repository you will find two differnt Jupyter notebooks, which have been used to document the process of each of these aims.



In the first Jupyter notebook I have reviewed Matplotlib and the use of Matplotlib plotting, concentrating on 3 main plots and their advantanges and disadvantages.

I had also included the brief for this project for review in a seperate folder.



In the second Jupyter notebook, I have downloaded and worked on the CAO points for 2021, 2020 and 2019.

These files are in three different forms - HTML, Excel and a PDF.

I have used Pandas to create a dataframe of these yearly points - these included level 6, 7, & 8 points.

Cleaning this data and ensuring that all of this data is ready to work on takes up a large portion of the CAO Jupyter notebook.

### Anaconda Install

To install and use Python you can download it directly [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

You can install this on your Windows, Mac or Linux OS

[2]

<br/>

### Additional Requirements

(Please note that these specifications are for Windows and may differ for the other OS)

It is also recommended that you should install the following along side Anaconda

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - This is a code editor and will allow you to create and view the code. 


[CMDR](https://cmder.net/) - which will allow you to access the terminal on your computer - you can use this as an alternative command line. Through this you can push commands to run the code on your device.


[Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Which will allow you to connect with Guthub and Fork this respository

[3][4][5]

<br/>

### Accessing Git Hub

When you have installed Anaconda and the additional required programs you can then fork github - this allows you to take a copy of this repository and save it to your computer where you can interact with the code - running it, changing it, and testing different parts of it. 

None of these actions you make to this forked copy effects the repository

You will find this fork symbol on the top right of the repository. You can also star the repository allowing you to save the repository to come back to.

[6][7]

<br/>

### Libraries Used

For this project I have used the following librares within Python:

-  `NumPy`, which is numerical python

-  `Pandas`, which allows us to create dataframes and is a step up from the numerical capablities of `NumPy`

- `Matplotlib`, which I review and use for plotting

- `Seaborn`, which is built on `Matplotlib` and expands on its capabilities

- `Scipy`, which allows for use to analyise data

- `requests`, a HTTP library for Python

<br/>

If you do not either have the space on your device for this full Python download Install or are perhaps reviewing this Repository as a starting point for Python and Jupyter Notebookes, I have also included below the details to access the notebooks without downloading Anaconda.

## Jupyter Notebooks

This project is completed using two [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

Jupyter can be launched via CMDR and works through your browser. This is an open source notebook that allows you to run your code, testing it, changing it and viewing the outputs in one place.

It is visually clean, and allows for the users to view the code and outputs clearly.

Navigate in your CMDR to the file you would like to save your notebook and type either Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

These will launch a notebook via your browser - you can then create a new file - choosing the Python 3 option. This is an interactive Python page which allows you to run and save code.

This is now an interactive Jupyter Notebook.

When you are finished within the notebook you can use CTRL S - saving the file, and close the browser.

Then in CDMR use CTRL C to close the notebook browser which will continue to run in the background.

For additional information on Jupyter Notebooks please review [here.](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/)

[8][9]

### Viewing & Running Notebooks
<br/>

As outlined above if you do not want to install Anaconda you can run the notebook in both an online viewer and also in Binder which will allow you to interact with the code without changing the notebook.

<br/>

NBViewer offers a static overview of the notebook - here you can view the code but there is no ability to interact with the code or run the code.


[![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.org/github/VCurry20/FDAProject2021/tree/main/)


<br/>

Binder offers users the choice to interact with the code without needing any installation of programs to your device. You can change the code - run the code - amend the code. None of this will be saved and allows you the opportunity to test with no reprocussions.

I would like to acknowledge that for the CAO notebook in particular this was completed following the lectures by Dr Ian McLoughlin, as part of the Fundamentals of Data Analysis Module for the GMIT HDip in Computing, in Data Analysis.
