## Purpose of this Repository

In this repository you will find two differnt Jupyter notebooks.

In the first, I have downloaded and worked on the CAO points for 2021, 2020 and 2019.

These files are in three different forms - HTML, Excel and a PDF.

I have used Pandas to create a dataframe of these Yearly points - these included level 6, 7, & 8 points.

Cleaning this data and ensuring that all of this data is ready to work on takes up a large portion of the CAO Jupyter notebook.

In the second Jupyter notebook I have reviewed Matplotlib and the use of Matplotlib plotting, concentrating on 3 main plots and their advantanges and disadvantages.

I had also included the brief for this project for review in a seperate folder.

<br/>

### Libraries Used

For this project I have used Python, specifically Anaconda and within Python I have used:

-  `NumPy`, which is numerical python

-  `Pandas`, which allows us to create dataframes and is a step up from the numerical capablities of `NumPy`

- `Matplotlib`, which I review and use for plotting

- `Seaborn`, which is built on `Matplotlib` and expands on its capabilities

- `Scipy`, which allows for use to analyise data

- `requests`, a HTTP library for Python

<br/>

### Anaconda Install

To install and use Python you can download it directly [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

You can install this on your Windows, Mac or Linux OS

<br/>

(Please note that these specifications are for Windows and may differ for the other OS)

It is also recommended that you should install the following along side Anaconda

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - This is a code editor and will allow you to create and view the code


[CMDR](https://cmder.net/) - which will allow you to access the terminal on your computer - you can use this as an alternative command line


[Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Which will allow you to connect with Guthub and Fork this respository
